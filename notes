# what is calibration/optimization/parameter estimation.

# gradient based vs not
# complex model vs statistical surogate

# introduction to the model we will use
diffusion of heat + fitting Clow paper data.

# model A = thermal diffusion
# model B = temperature history of the surface
# OF = RMSE fit of temperatures


A black box model: Start with Dakota input params.in and 
create results.out.  
* pre run (fill in the {{values}}
* run
* post run, make a plot with plotnine/pandas
* you get to choose how much you keep

Step 1: Brute force grid search

- introduction to the input file. 
- introduction to the model driver
- introduction to the file structure.

- Run. Look at plot, look at .dat .out file. 
(FYI, we don't need to keep the file structure) 


Step 2: Gradient based method

- we just change the METHOD!!!!!

Step 3: EGO 

Discussion:
* computational cost of Dakota method vs complex model evaluation. 
    - calculation of numerical gradients
    - increasing dimension
    - 
* RST file, .out file and reproducible research


Exploration if time:
* Explore other methods
* Add a second component of the objective function.
* Make the model (of surface temperature history) more complex.
