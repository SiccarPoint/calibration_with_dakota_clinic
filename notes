# what is calibration/optimization/parameter estimation.

# gradient based vs not
# complex model vs statistical surogate

# introduction to the model we will use
diffusion of heat + fitting Clow paper data.

# model A = thermal diffusion
# model B = temperature history of the surface
# OF = RMSE fit of temperatures


* pre run (fill in the {{values}}
* run
* post run, make a plot with plotnine/pandas

Step 1: Brute force grid search

- introduction to the input file. 
- introduction to the model driver
- introduction to the file structure. 

Step 2: Gradient based method

- we just change the METHOD!!!!!

Step 3: EGO 

If time: on our own we will explore other methods, make the surface temperature model more complex, etc.
