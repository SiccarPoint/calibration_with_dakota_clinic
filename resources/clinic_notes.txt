Intro to calibration
- what is calibration/optimization/parameter estimation.
- gradient based vs global
- complex model vs statistical surogate
- black box model (parameters > model > outputs)
- parameters and outputs must be defined.

Our toy model
- diffusion of heat + surface temperature history
- OF based on fitting Clow paper data.

Intro to Dakota 
- Dakota has more bells and whistles, it is well thought out, and the documentation is quite good. Its just extensive and not an iPhone.  
- Core activity (assuming you have a black box model set up) is to create and run an input file. 
- Look at .in file. 
    * discuss each part
- Look at template file and driver.py (connect this with black box parts)
- Run Dakota, create plots, look at output. 
- Discuss Dakota's file structure

Other methods
We just did a brute force grid search. 
Step 2: Gradient based method
Step 3: EGO 

Discussion:
* computational cost of Dakota method vs complex model evaluation. 
    - calculation of numerical gradients
    - increasing dimension
    - 
* RST file, .out file and reproducible research
* We haven't yet talked about the uncertainty estimates on  parameters, just which  
parameter is best. That is for another day.  

Exploration if time:
* Explore other methods
* Add a second component of the objective function.
* Make the model (of surface temperature history) more complex.
