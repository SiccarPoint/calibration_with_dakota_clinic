# Intro to calibration
- what is calibration/optimization/parameter estimation.
- black box model (parameters > model > outputs)
- parameters and outputs must be defined.

- gradient based vs global
- complex model vs statistical surogate
- parameter uncertainty or just best parameter set

# Our toy model
- diffusion of heat + surface temperature history
- OF based on fitting Clow paper data.

# Intro to Dakota
- Dakota has more bells and whistles, it is well thought out, and the
  documentation is quite good. Its just extensive and not an iPhone.
- Core activity (assuming you have a black box model set up) is to create and
  run an input file.
- Look at .in file.
    * discuss each part
- Look at template file and driver.py (connect this with black box parts)
- Run Dakota, create plots, look at output.
- Discuss Dakota's file structure

# Other methods
We just did a brute force grid search. This is sort of an optimization.
Next we will do a gradient based method and a global method.

# Discussion:
- computational cost of Dakota method vs complex model evaluation.
    * calculation of numerical gradients
    * increasing dimension
- do you need parameter estimates, or just a best fit point.
- RST file, .out file and reproducible research
- We haven't yet talked about the uncertainty estimates on  parameters, just
  which parameter is best. That is for another day.

# Exploration if time:
* Explore other methods
* Add a second component of the objective function.
* Make the model (of surface temperature history) more complex.
